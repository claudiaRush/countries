# Countries

This is the final, finished project for my Intro to Web Design course. The website allows users to search/partial search for countries, select a country, and add a card with some basic information about that country. Multiple cards can be added or removed. Selecting the "show wiki links" button shows some additional information and links to Wikipedia articles, this button can be toggled off at any time.
